Developing something for Hoyoverse games? Here's a collection of Python async API wrappers for Hoyoverse games made by me:

- [enka.py](https://github.com/seriaati/enka-py) is an Enka Network API wrapper for fetching in-game showcase.
- [yatta.py](https://github.com/seriaati/yatta) is a Project Yatta API wrapper for fetching Honkai Star Rail game data.
- [ambr.py](https://github.com/seriaati/ambr) is a Project Ambr API wrapper for fetching Genshin Impact game data.
- [hakushin.py](https://github.com/seriaati/hakushin-py) is a Hakushin API wrapper for fetching Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail beta game data.
